Today,I optimized the server deployment tools for server and ran them in production environment. After that,
I sent a notification about the pipeline through Feishu. 
In the Afternoon,I visited the Apple Store to see the latest Apple products. They were beautiful ,but also a 
little expensive. At two o'clock,I talked with my teammate.He showed me what they have been working on recently.
When I saw it,I really liked it,and I felt proud of them and what they have achieved.Later,I developed some frontend 
pages,improved the UI and enhanced their functionality
